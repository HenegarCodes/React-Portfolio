# Portoflio

## Description
Welcome to my Portfolio. As you probably have learned my name is Spencer Henegar. I am a Full Stack Engineer with a knack for large problem solving and debugging. This portfolio is done in reactjs, javascript, HTML, and CSS. I created this because I love reactjs because of its functionality. I will be creating the backend soon to this for the email message piece to be functional. My projects represent my growth and my top 3 projects on the site are my most proud that contain mainly full stack components regarding backend and frontend services.
